# Fuse

Fuse is a database designed to be easy to use and quick to iterate on. It is not meant for high performance workloads
and is instead meant to be used for prototyping or workloads that are no going to be "stress tested".

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an easy to use NoSQL database that feels like querying a json object. It is meant to be used
in small projects or for prototyping.

Another goal of this project is to us as little external dependencies as possible and have everything be coded from scratch as this
is primarly (at least for now) just a fun little side project to learn various things.
